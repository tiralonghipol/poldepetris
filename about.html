<p> Hei, I am Paolo! <br> 
    I was born in Trieste (TS), a small city in the North-East of Italy, where I attended my Primary, Middle and High school.
    I then moved to Torino (TO) where I got my B.Sc. (Telecommunications Engineering) and M.Sc. (Mechatronic Engineering),
    both at Politecnico di Torino.<br>
    I'm deeply in love with drones and robotics.
    In 2017, while studying, I worked on the design and implementation algorithms of an  autonomous UAV for a local company.
    After that, I succesfully completed the Master ICT and Advanced Projecting (2 years) at the University of Torino, to improve my skills. </br>
    In my free time I study electric guitar and sometimes I write songs. I also love to do a lot of physical activity. </p>
    
    <p>I am currently working with Dr. Kostas Alexis at the Autonomous Robots Lab (<a
        href="https://www.autonomousrobotslab.com/" target="_blank"><b>ARL</b>) </a>. 
    After one year spent at the University of Nevada, Reno (USA), where I got my second M.Sc. (Computer Science),
    I moved to Trondheim (NO), as a PhD candidate at NTNU.
