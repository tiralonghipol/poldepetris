<span class="image main"><img src="images/ars.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>The main goal of the ARS (Autonomous Remote Sensing) project was to design and prototype a drone
    capable of carrying out autonomous inspection of confined spaces, in particular of tunnels.
    Exploiting the concept of Data Muling, the UAV was able to navigate inside a GPS-denied environment
    without any help from the operator, collecting data from pre-disposed BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
    modules and, in post-processing, create a 3D model of the inspected environment with an average
    error of
    ~1mm.

<b>Autonomous Indoor UAV Navigation & Mapping</b>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.png" alt="" /></span>
<p>A project for indoor, unknown, GPS-denied environment navigation of UAVs.
    The main used sensors are a 2D Lidar laser scanner range finder and a Pixhawk flight controller.
    All computation are performed onboard.

<p>A simple mini CNC plotter realized with some old CD Drives found in the basement.
    I initially used <a href="http://www.ardumotive.com/new-cnc-plotter.html" target="_blank"><b>this
            guide</b></a> as a reference, then I implemented my own configuration.
    You can see my tiny printer in action <a
